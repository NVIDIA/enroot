# All files in this directory named *.conf are read in shell expansion order
# (ie, asciicographical, possibly influenced by LC_COLLATE)
#
# Any file to be processed must adhere to the same format as enroot.conf.
# See there for details.
#
# If necessary, a numbering scheme (10-default.conf, 20-local.conf, 30-....conf)
# might be beneficial.
